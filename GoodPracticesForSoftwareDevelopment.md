### Good Practices for Software Development
### Question 1:Which point(s) were new to you?
  - Using sandbox environments like Codepen, Codesandbox to share the entire setup when asking questions about code issues.
  - Utilizing tools like TimeLimit, Freedom, or similar apps to block social media sites and apps during work hours to improve productivity

### Question 2:Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
  - Set up reminders or alarms to ensure I inform relevant team members immediately when facing issues such as internet connectivity problems or delays in implementation.
  - Encourage open communication within the team to ensure everyone feels comfortable sharing updates and addressing challenges collectively.
