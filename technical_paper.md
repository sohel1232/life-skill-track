# SQL Report: Basics, Joins, and Aggregations

## Introduction

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a powerful tool used for managing and manipulating data in relational database management systems (RDBMS). It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, allowing users to perform various operations such as querying data, combining data from multiple tables using joins, and performing calculations on groups of data using aggregations. In this report, we will explore the basics of SQL along with code samples demonstrating how to perform these operations.

## SQL Basics

SQL queries are used to retrieve data from databases. The `SELECT` statement is the most commonly used SQL command for querying data. Here's a basic example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

This query selects all columns from the `employees` table. You can also specify specific columns by listing them after the `SELECT` keyword.

## Joins in SQL

Joins are used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are several types of joins in SQL, including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN. Here's an example of an INNER JOIN:

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

This query selects specific columns from both the `employees` (aliased as `e`) and `departments` (aliased as `d`) tables where the `department_id` matches in both tables.

## Aggregations in SQL

Aggregations are used to perform calculations on groups of rows to return a single value. Common aggregate functions include `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`. Here's an example of using the `SUM` function:

```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees;
```

This query calculates the sum of the `salary` column from the `employees` table and aliases the result as `total_salary`.

## Conclusion

SQL is a versatile language that allows users to interact with databases efficiently. In this report, we explored the basics of SQL, including querying data, performing joins to combine data from multiple tables, and using aggregations to analyze data. Understanding these fundamental concepts is essential for anyone working with databases, as they form the building blocks of data manipulation and analysis. With SQL, users have the tools to extract valuable insights from data and make informed decisions.
